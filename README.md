# HTML-CSS-JS-Portfolio
This is a portfolio made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
You can edit this and make yourself a basic Portfolio where you can upload your resume and show your projects.  
I have also created a contact me page which is not functional as of now (Well that's where your creativity comes into play).
